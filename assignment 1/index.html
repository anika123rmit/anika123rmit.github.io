        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h2>
      I noticed a number of visual components that were brought to my attention
      as soon as I opened the website. The occurring motif of colour changes
      caught my attention, along with the lopsided distribution of colours,
      which changed dynamically as I navigated the page with my computer mouse.
      The website felt dynamic and alive to me because of this interactive
      effect, which elevated a basic browsing experience to me that was
      extremely captivating and immersive. I was inspired to look into it
      further and engage with the website more because of the colourful aspect
      that the colours brought.

          2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        I started by placing the computer mouse in the middle of the page and
        watching how the colours changed in response to small movements. I then
        noted the changing colours as I moved the cursor around the page's
        corners in no specific order. Next, I hovered over the bold outlined
        words in the sentence, which drew my attention to textual changes. I
        also noticed that the colours changed from orange to purple, which made
        the experience even more exciting. Finally, I experimented with diagonal
        and vertical mouse movements, further seeing how the interactive parts
        reacted to different computer mouse movements.

            3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
            with?
          </h4>
          I spent the most time interacting with the pageâ€™s element of the
          colour-changing feature. While the text colour changed from pink to
          green in sync with the background's changes, the background would
          alternate between four different colours: green, blue, pink, and
          purple. The fluidity of these changes was interesting to watch, as the
          colour distribution changed regularly. Depending on where the computer
          mouse was positioned, the area covered by each colour increased or
          decreased, producing a dynamic and captivating visual effect that
          promoted constant involvement for me as the user.
